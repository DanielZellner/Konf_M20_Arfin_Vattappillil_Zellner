# Konf_M20_Arfin_Vattappillil_Zellner
first Task
Zellner: to set all up
Zellner: Cocktail class created, extends Drink class
Arfin: I've created a class name vodka, which is extends in Drink class. 
Vattappillil; Created a class called Lemonade, extends Drink class. 

second Task, 25.04.2021
Arfin: I created the VodkaTest with right click on Vodka class then generate -> Test... -> VodkaTest.. at IntelliJ IDEA and then downloaded the IntelliJ IDEA version 16 but did not work, downloaded another version 15. Then the VodakaTest worked 100%. 
Zellner: I created the CocktailTest to Test the Cocktail class, I basically started to create a new test folder in the SRC folder, where a package was created again (at.fhj.iit), for each method you write a test to cover 100% of the test cases, the constructor is not included, because normally this is not necessary. CocktailTest covers 100% of Cocktail up. Basically how the testing work:
you have a method like: isAlcoholic(), this method returns true, so in your test you check if the outcome of the merhod is actually true.
