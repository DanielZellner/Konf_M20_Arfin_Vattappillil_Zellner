second Task, 25.04.2021
Arfin: I worked with IntelliJ IDEA. Explaining how I creadted  the VodkaTestclass: I created the VodkaTest with right click on Vodka class then generate -> Test... -> then you can choose which methos you want to test... we tested all the methods such getVolume, getAlcohol, isAlcoholic, toString and finally my VodkaTest class was created..After that I downloaded the IntelliJ IDEA version 16 but did not work -> then I got an Error. Then I downloaded another version 15 and then my VodkaTest worked perfectly. The VodakaTest worked 100%. Explaining how to run: left click on the symbol "Run" and choose "Run VodkaTest(1) with Coverage". Finally we added it on our repository. $ git pull -> $ git branch vodka_branch -> $ git branch -> $ git checkout vodka_branch -> git status -> git add -> git push -u orgin <vodka_branch>; 
Zellner: I created the CocktailTest to Test the Cocktail class, I basically started to create a new test folder in the SRC folder, where a package was created again (at.fhj.iit), for each method you write a test to cover 100% of the test cases, the constructor is not included, because normally this is not necessary. CocktailTest covers 100% of Cocktail up. Basically how the testing work:
you have a method like: isAlcoholic(), this method returns true, so in your test you check if the outcome of the merhod is actually true.
Vattappillil: I opened IntelliJ and generated a test class. I had to download some specific JDK Versions and at first there were many problems because all of my imports didn't work. After some time repairing I tested everything and my Testclass was at 100%. 
Quellen: Stackoverflow, da wir Probleme mit der 16er Version hatten und deshalb die 15er Version brauchten. (Fehlermedlung: Could not initialize class org.jetbrains.jps.builders.JpsBuildBundle)
